   QUICK FILE NAVIGATION:
   You can open any file by typing ⌘P (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+P) to activate Quick Open. Then, type the name of the file you want to open.
   This is especially useful when you know the file’s name and want to quickly jump to it.

   SWITCHING BETWEEN OPEN FILES:
   Hold Ctrl and press Tab to view a list of all files open in the current editor group.
   To open one of these files, use Tab again to select the desired file, then release Ctrl.
   Alternatively, use ⌃- (Windows: Alt+Left, Linux: Ctrl+Alt+-) to navigate backward and ⌃⇧- (Windows: Alt+Right, Linux: Ctrl+Shift+-) to navigate forward between files and edit locations1.

   BREADCRUMBS:
   The editor has a navigation bar called Breadcrumbs above its contents.
   Breadcrumbs show the current location (file path) and allow you to quickly navigate between folders, files, and symbols.
   You can customize breadcrumb appearance and turn it on/off using settings.
   To interact with breadcrumbs, use the Focus Breadcrumbs command or press ⇧⌘. (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+.)

   EXTENSIONS:
   Consider installing extensions like “File Jumper” from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
   File Jumper allows you to right-click on a file in the file explorer panel or on a file tab and quickly jump to related files


   OPENING FILES AND FOLDERS:
   You can open a single folder as a workspace by using the “File > Open Folder…” menu.
   If you launch VS Code from a terminal, pass the path to a folder as the first argument to the code command. For example

   MANAGING WORKSPACES:
   A workspace in VS Code is a collection of one or more folders opened in a single instance.
   You can configure settings, tasks, and debugger launch configurations specific to a workspace.
   Multi-root workspaces allow you to include multiple distinct folders in the same workspace. You create a .code-workspace JSON file listing all folders.
   To add folders to a workspace, use the “File > Add Folder to Workspace…” command

8. Settings and Preferences:

      The first step is to set a breakpoint in your code. A breakpoint is a specific line where you want the debugger to pause execution. Click on the left margin of the line where you want to set the breakpoint, or use the keyboard shortcut F9.

   2. CREATE A LAUNCH CONFIGURATION:
      While you can run and debug your active file without a configuration, it’s beneficial to create a launch configuration. This configuration specifies how VS Code should run your code in debug mode.

   3. TO CREATE A LAUNCH CONFIGURATION:
      Open your Python file in VS Code.
      Click on the Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
      Select Create a launch.json file.
      VS Code will try to automatically detect your debug environment, but if it fails, choose it manually.

   4. START DEBUGGING:
      Press F5 or click the green play button in the top bar to start debugging.
      VS Code will execute your code and pause at the breakpoint you set.

   5. INSPECT VARIABLES:
      While debugging, you can inspect variables and expressions. Use the Variables panel to view their values.

   6. STEP THROUGH YOUR CODE:
      Use the debugging controls (step over, step into, step out) to navigate through your code line by line.
      The Call Stack panel shows the function call hierarchy.

   7. CONTINUE EXECUTION:
      To continue running your program after a breakpoint, click the play button or press F5.

   8. FIX THE ERROR:
    Once you’ve identified the issue, make necessary changes to your code and continue debugging until it works correctly.

    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) offers robust debugging features that can significantly enhance your development workflow. Here are some key features:

   Built-in Debugger:
   VS Code has a built-in debugger that supports the Node.js runtime. It can also debug JavaScript, TypeScript, and any other language transpiled to JavaScript1.
   Additionally, you can find debugger extensions for various languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Go, C++, PowerShell) in the VS Code Marketplace.

   Breakpoints:
   Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution at specific lines. You can inspect variables and expressions at these points.
   Enhanced features include conditional breakpoints.

   Watch Variables:
   Monitor the progress of variables within scope during debugging.

   Call Stack:
   View the function call hierarchy in the Call Stack panel.

   Launch Configurations:
   Create a launch.json file to configure and save debugging settings. VS Code keeps this file in a .vscode folder within your workspace.

   Step Through Code:
   Use step-over, step-into, and step-out controls to navigate through your code line by line


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides seamless integration with Git for version control. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, here’s how you can get started:

   1. INSTALL GIT:
      First, ensure that Git is installed on your computer. If it’s missing, VS Code will prompt you to install it.
      Restart VS Code after installing Git.

   2. OPEN A GIT REPOSITORY:
   There are several ways to open a Git repository in VS Code:

   Clone a Repository Locally:
      Use the Git: Clone command in the Command Palette (⇧⌘P or Windows/Linux Ctrl+Shift+P).
      Authenticate with GitHub if you’re cloning from there.
      Select a repository to clone to your machine.

   Initialize a Local Repository:
      Open an existing or new folder in VS Code.
      In the Source Control view, click the Initialize Repository button.
      This creates a new Git repository in the current folder.
   
3. Publish to GitHub:
   You can initialize a local repository and publish it directly to GitHub:
      Use the “Publish to GitHub” command in the Source Control view.
      Choose a name, description, and whether it’s public or private.
      VS Code pushes your local code to the remote repository on GitHub.

5. Common Git Actions:
   Once you’re set up, perform common Git actions directly within VS Code:
      Commit changes.
      Create and merge branches.
      Push and pull code.
      Collaborate with others using commits and pull requests

Let’s walk through the process of initializing a Git repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub:

1. Initialize a Repository:
      To start tracking changes in your project, navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
      Run "git init" to create a new Git repository. This initializes a hidden ".git" directory to manage version history.


2. Add and Commit Changes:
      Add files to the staging area using "git add ." (to stage all changes) or "git add <filename>" (for specific files).
      Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m "Your commit message".

3. Push to GitHub:
      Create a repository on GitHub (if you haven’t already).
      Add the remote repository URL to your local Git using: "git remote add origin <repository_url>"
      Push your local changes to GitHub: "git push origin master"
      Replace master with the branch name you’re working on (e.g., main).
